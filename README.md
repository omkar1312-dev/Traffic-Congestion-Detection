# Traffic-Congestion-Detection

Welcome to the Traffic Congestion Detection project repository. This private repository contains code and resources related to traffic congestion detection using image data.

## Overview

This project focuses on detecting traffic congestion levels using image data. The steps involved include:

- Data Collection: The dataset was obtained from Kaggle [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rahat52/traffic-density-singapore]. It includes labeled images depicting various traffic scenes.

- Data Visualization: generates visualizations of the images along with their respective class labels.

- Image Preprocessing: converts the images to grayscale to facilitate further analysis.

- Model Training: trains a model to predict traffic congestion levels based on the preprocessed images.

Results
After training, the model achieved an accuracy of 75% on the validation set.
